---

Note patches for every release of Tensorflow is different! So the instructions work for v2.0.0 only.

First make sure your XCode 9.4.1, CUDA 10.0 SDK and CUDNN 7.4/7.6 are properly installed, and Internet connection is also required. Install Python3 using `Homebrew` if you need to compile for Python3.


## For Python 3.6 / 3.7
The following instructions will help you build your own wheel files for Python 3 with CUDA 10.0.

+ download Tensorflow sources and switch to `v2.0.0`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
cd tensorflow
git checkout v2.0.0
```
+ download and use source patches in this repo to patch sources:

```shell
git apply v2.0.0.patch

```
+ run `./configure`, note that:  
  - using `/usr/local/bin/python` if you want a build for python3.
  - select the correct site packages path.
  - Set correct CUDA compute capability values.
  - Use `/usr/bin/gcc` as the default compiler.
  
Here is an example for Python 3.7:

```
iMac18:tensorflow tomheaven$ ./configure
WARNING: Running Bazel server needs to be killed, because the startup options are different.
WARNING: --batch mode is deprecated. Please instead explicitly shut down your Bazel server using the command "bazel shutdown".
You have bazel 0.24.1 installed.
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]: /usr/local/bin/python3


Found possible Python library paths:
  /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.0/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.6/site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.0/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.6/site-packages]

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [Y/n]: n
No XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL SYCL support? [y/N]: 
No OpenCL SYCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with ROCm support? [y/N]: 
No ROCm support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Found CUDA 10.0 in:
    /usr/local/cuda/lib64
    /usr/local/cuda/include
Found cuDNN 7 in:
    /usr/local/cuda/lib64
    /usr/local/cuda/include


Please specify a list of comma-separated CUDA compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size, and that TensorFlow only supports compute capabilities >= 3.5 [Default is: 3.5,7.0]: 3.0,3.5,5.0,5.2,6.1,7.0


WARNING: XLA does not support CUDA compute capabilities lower than 3.5. Disable XLA when running on older GPUs.
Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N]: 
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler.

Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/local/bin/gcc]: /usr/bin/gcc


Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]: 
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native -Wno-sign-compare]: 


Would you like to interactively configure ./WORKSPACE for Android builds? [y/N]: 
Not configuring the WORKSPACE for Android builds.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with iOS support? [y/N]: 
No iOS support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Preconfigured Bazel build configs. You can use any of the below by adding "--config=<>" to your build command. See .bazelrc for more details.
	--config=mkl         	# Build with MKL support.
	--config=monolithic  	# Config for mostly static monolithic build.
	--config=gdr         	# Build with GDR support.
	--config=verbs       	# Build with libverbs support.
	--config=ngraph      	# Build with Intel nGraph support.
	--config=numa        	# Build with NUMA support.
	--config=dynamic_kernels	# (Experimental) Build kernels into separate shared objects.
	--config=v2          	# Build TensorFlow 2.x instead of 1.x.
Preconfigured Bazel build configs to DISABLE default on features:
	--config=noaws       	# Disable AWS S3 filesystem support.
	--config=nogcp       	# Disable GCP support.
	--config=nohdfs      	# Disable HDFS support.
	--config=noignite    	# Disable Apache Ignite support.
	--config=nokafka     	# Disable Apache Kafka support.
	--config=nonccl      	# Disable NVIDIA NCCL support.
Configuration finished
```
+ start building

```
bazel build --config=opt --config=nonccl //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```
Note `NCCL` only works on Linux now, which does not work on Mac OS X or Windows. We need to disable it by passing `--config=nonccl`, or you will meet NCCL related errors.

+ fix a source error in external sources. Previous building process will end with an error:
 
```
external/com_google_absl/absl/container/internal/compressed_tuple.h:170:53: error: use 'template' keyword to treat 'Storage' as a dependent template name
return (std::move(*this).internal_compressed_tuple::Storage< CompressedTuple, I> ::get()); 
```

Solution: Edit `bazel-tensorflow/external/com_google_absl/absl/container/internal/compressed_tuple.h:168-178` and comment out two problematic functions:

```cpp

/*template <int I>
  ElemT<I>&& get() && {
    return std::move(*this).internal_compressed_tuple::template Storage<CompressedTuple, I>::get();
  }
  template <int I>
  constexpr const ElemT<I>&& get() const&& {
    return absl::move(*this).internal_compressed_tuple::template Storage<CompressedTuple, I>::get();
  }*/

```
Then, build again using the same previous commands. This time, the building process should be successful.

+ generate a wheel package

```
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package ./
```

## For Python 2.7

For Python 2.7, we need an additional patch for external source file. Edit file `bazel-tensorflow/external/cython/Cython/Compiler/Nodes.py` and add the following lines at top:

```python
import sys
if sys.version < '3':
    reload(sys)
    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
```
Note external source patch can be applied only after the first build failure because external sources are downloaded at the beginning of the building process.
